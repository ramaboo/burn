        p.card-text We have a small sound system and you should bring your own MP3 player. A cheap MP3 player is better than your phone because you probably don't want your phone broken and there is no internet service on playa. The speaker has 1/8", RCA, and XLR inputs. Bluetooth is unreliable in the dust. We turn out music on at 11:00 am to allow campers to sleep in and turn it off at 3:00 am so our neighbors don't hate us.
