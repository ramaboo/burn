        p.card-text Burning Man is expensive yet supposed to be radically inclusive. Running a camp is also expensive, so it is necessary for us all to contribute financially to help cover these costs which include things like:
        ul
          li Truck rental
          li Equipment purchases, repair and replacement
          li Camp infrastructure and container storage
          li Fuel for cooking stoves, generators, and sauna
          li Tools and other shared camp resources
          li A million tiny other things that add up quickly
        p.card-text If we split dues evenly then we would become unaffordable for some, and that would suck. As such we have four tiers of dues this year based on annual income:
        ul
          - Settings.pricing_tiers.each
            li #{_1[1].description_and_price}

        p.card-text We first did tiered dues in 2019 and the feedback was overwhelmingly positive. Burning Man is changing. It's hard to ignore the fact that it's becoming a playground for only the rich and that's not good. That's not what Burning Man was meant to be. This is our small way of trying to balance that inequality.

        p.card-text The amount we each pay for dues is the same amount we each put down for a deposit, because the pain of forfeiting a deposit should be felt equally by all.

        p.card-text We have a hard deadline of August 15th for accepting new members. However, camp will likely sell out before then.

        p.card-text Camp dues are non-refundable under any circumstances. We spend this money and once it's gone we can't unbuy things.
