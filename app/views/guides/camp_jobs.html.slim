        p.card-text We all participate in running camp.
        p.card-text We use a point system to divide up work. Once your camp application is approved you will be able to sign up for jobs online.
        p.card-text 1 point is worth roughly 1 hour of work. You will need to sign up for 10 points worth of jobs.
        p.card-text There are lots of different kinds of jobs that need doing to keep camp running smoothly. We will post individual job descriptions as we get closer to the event.
